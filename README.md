# Introduction

This repo is a simple example that uses the **objalloc** library in binutils libiberty.
The example is a string list that uses **objallo** to manage the dynamic allocated memory spaces for its entries.

**objalloc** sources are copied directly from binutils:
* https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/master/libiberty/objalloc.c
* https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/master/include/objalloc.h
(The *config.h* is generated by `configure`.)


# Compile and run

```
$ gcc *.c -o list
$ ./list
list[0] = hello
list[1] = world
```
